   â€¢ No need to manually specify each role
   â€¢ AI proposes complete team in seconds
   â€¢ Interactive refinement if needed

[green]3. Better Outcomes[/green]
   â€¢ Teams designed with success factors in mind
   â€¢ Potential challenges identified upfront
   â€¢ Clear role definitions and interactions

[green]4. Learning System[/green]
   â€¢ AI learns from successful team patterns
   â€¢ Incorporates organizational context
   â€¢ Evolves recommendations over time

[green]5. Flexibility[/green]
