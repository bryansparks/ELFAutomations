# Team Evolution Integration Complete

## Date: June 13, 2025

## Summary
Successfully integrated the team improvement and evolution system into the team factory. Teams can now:
1. Log all conversations to Supabase
2. Learn from their experiences
3. Evolve their prompts based on successful patterns
4. Run improvement cycles (daily/weekly/manual)
5. A/B test evolved agents before applying changes

## Key Changes

### 1. TeamSpecification Model Enhanced
- Added evolution flags:
  - `enable_evolution`: Allow agents to evolve
  - `enable_conversation_logging`: Log team communications
  - `enable_memory`: Use persistent memory (already existed)
  - `evolution_confidence_threshold`: Min confidence for changes (default 0.9)
  - `improvement_cycle_frequency`: daily/weekly/manual
  - `memory_retention_days`: How long to keep memories

### 2. Agent Generation Updates
**Location**: `tools/team_factory/generators/agents/crewai_v2.py`
- Agents now check for evolved prompts on initialization
- Uses `EvolvedAgentLoader` to load improvements from Supabase
- Conversation logging integrated into agent execution
- Logs task assignments, completions, and failures

### 3. Improvement Loop Generator
**New**: `tools/team_factory/generators/evolution/improvement_loop.py`
- Generates complete improvement loop setup:
  - `evolution/run_improvement_loop.py` - Main improvement script
  - `evolution/evolution_config.yaml` - Evolution settings
  - `evolution/setup_cron.sh` - Automated scheduling
- Runs full improvement cycles:
  - Analyzes team performance
  - Identifies successful patterns
  - Generates evolved prompts
  - Tests with A/B testing
  - Applies high-confidence improvements

### 4. UI Integration
- Team charter capture now includes evolution settings
- Users can choose:
  - Whether to enable evolution
  - Improvement frequency (daily/weekly/manual)
  - Confidence threshold for changes

## How It Works

### 1. During Team Operation
```python
# Agents log all communications
self._conversation_logger.log_message(
    agent_name=self.role,
    message="Completed task successfully",
    message_type=MessageType.TASK_COMPLETION
)
```

### 2. Daily/Weekly Improvement Cycle
```bash
# Runs automatically via cron
cd teams/your-team/evolution
python run_improvement_loop.py
```

### 3. Evolution Process
1. **Analyze**: Reviews conversation logs and episode outcomes
2. **Learn**: Extracts patterns from successful interactions
3. **Evolve**: Generates improved prompts with proven strategies
4. **Test**: A/B tests evolved agents vs base versions
5. **Apply**: Updates agents with high-confidence improvements

### 4. Example Evolution
```python
# Original prompt:
"You are a software developer who writes code"

# Evolved prompt (after learning):
"You are a software developer who writes code. Based on experience:
- Always validate inputs before processing (prevented 85% of errors)
- Use type hints for better code clarity (improved team collaboration)
- Write tests before implementation (reduced bugs by 60%)"
```

## File Structure
```
teams/{team-name}/
├── evolution/
│   ├── run_improvement_loop.py    # Main improvement script
│   ├── evolution_config.yaml      # Evolution settings
│   ├── setup_cron.sh             # Automated scheduling
│   └── reports/                  # Improvement reports
├── logs/
│   └── conversations/            # Team communication logs
└── agents/
    └── *.py                      # Agents with evolution support
```

## Database Integration
- Uses existing Supabase tables:
  - `team_conversations` - All team communications
  - `agent_evolutions` - Prompt evolution history
  - `team_episodes` - Task execution history
- Analytical views for pattern identification

## Benefits
1. **Continuous Improvement**: Teams get better over time automatically
2. **Evidence-Based**: Changes based on proven successful patterns
3. **Safe Evolution**: High confidence threshold + A/B testing
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Learnings persist across sessions
5. **Transparent**: All changes tracked and auditable

## Next Steps for Users
1. Create teams with evolution enabled (default)
2. Let teams operate normally
3. Review improvement reports in `evolution/reports/`
4. Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
5. Monitor team performance improvements

## Technical Notes
- Evolution is opt-in per team
- Conversation logging respects privacy settings
- A/B tests run for minimum 24 hours
- Rollback available for all evolutions
- Compatible with both CrewAI and LangGraph

The system is now ready for teams to learn and improve autonomously!
