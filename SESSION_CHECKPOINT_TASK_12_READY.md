## Task 12: Registry Awareness (NEXT)

### Problem Statement
Teams and services need to be aware of the Team Registry to:
- Query organizational structure
- Discover other teams' capabilities
- Update their own status
- Find appropriate teams for delegation

### Expected Work
1. **Registry Client Integration**
   - Add registry client to shared modules
   - Integrate with team base classes
   - Auto-registration on team startup

2. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - Query teams by capability
   - Find teams by department
   - Get team hierarchies
   - Discover team contact points

3. **Status Updates**
   - Teams report their health
   - Update capability listings
   - Track availability status

4. **Integration Points**
   - Team Factory auto-registration
   - A2A client registry lookups
   - MCP server team discovery

### Prerequisites Completed
- âœ… Team Registry schema created (`/sql/create_team_registry.sql`)
- âœ… Team Registry MCP server (`/mcp-servers-ts/src/team-registry/`)
- âœ… MCP client with discovery (Task 11)
- âœ… Credential management for secure access

## Key Context for Task 12

### Team Registry Schema
```sql
-- Main tables already created:
- teams (id, name, type, parent_id, metadata)
- team_members (team_id, agent_name, role, capabilities)
- team_relationships (parent_id, child_id, relationship_type)
- team_audit_log (team_id, action, details, timestamp)
```

### Team Registry MCP Tools Available
1. `register_team` - Register new team
2. `add_team_member` - Add member to team
3. `query_teams` - Query by criteria
4. `get_team_hierarchy` - Get org structure
5. `get_executive_teams` - Get teams by executive
6. `update_team_relationship` - Update reporting
7. `get_team_members` - Get team composition
8. `get_team_composition` - Get summary stats

### Integration Architecture
```
Teams â†’ Registry Client â†’ MCP Client â†’ Team Registry MCP â†’ Supabase
         â†“
    Cached Data
         â†“
    Fast Lookups
```

## Environment Status

### Credentials Needed
- **Master Password**: `ElfAutomations2025SecureVault!` (stored securely)
- **Action Required**: Rotate exposed credentials on platforms

### Deployment Info
- **Dev Machine**: MacBook
- **ArgoCD Machine**: Mac Mini (192.168.6.5)
- **K8s**: OrbStack
- **Namespace**: elf-automations

### Test Commands for Task 12
```bash
# Test registry MCP
python scripts/test_team_registry_mcp.py

# Check teams in registry
python scripts/check_team_registry.py

# Test via MCP client
python scripts/check_registry_via_mcp.py
```

## Quick Start for Task 12

When you return:

1. **Read this checkpoint**: `SESSION_CHECKPOINT_TASK_12_READY.md`
2. **Review CLAUDE.md**: Current progress and completed tasks
3. **Check registry status**: Run test scripts above
4. **Start implementation**: Begin with registry client in shared modules

### First Steps for Task 12
```python
# 1. Create registry client
/elf_automations/shared/registry/client.py

# 2. Add to team base
/elf_automations/shared/team/base.py  

# 3. Update team factory
/tools/team_factory.py (add auto-registration)

# 4. Create tests
/scripts/test_registry_awareness.py
```

## Key Decisions Made

### Architectural Patterns
1. **MCP for Registry Access**: Use MCP instead of direct DB
2. **Client-Side Caching**: Cache registry data for performance
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Teams emit events on changes
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Work without registry if unavailable

### Security Model
- Registry access through team credentials
- Read access for all teams
- Write access only for own team data
- Audit logging for all changes

## Success Criteria for Task 12

1. **Auto-Registration**: New teams automatically appear in registry
2. **Discovery Works**: Teams can find each other by capability
3. **Updates Flow**: Status changes propagate through system
4. **Performance**: Registry lookups don't slow team operations
5. **Resilience**: System works even if registry is down

## Final Notes

- Task 11 provides the MCP infrastructure needed for Task 12
- Team Registry MCP server is ready and tested
- All prerequisites are in place
- Focus on making registry awareness transparent to teams
