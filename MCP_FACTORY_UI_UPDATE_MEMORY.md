# MCP Factory UI Update Memory

## Context
We successfully enhanced the MCP Server Factory (mcp_server_factory.py) with:
1. 5 template types: tool-focused, resource-focused, prompt-focused, balanced, api-facade, custom
2. Fixed terminology: "external" instead of "external-wrapper"
3. Default transport: "http" instead of "stdio"
4. Better UI flow with clear exit options and summaries
5. API Facade template for wrapping external APIs (e.g., FamilySearch)

## Completed Work

### 1. MCP Server Factory Script Updates
- Fixed TypeScript config boolean issue (True/False vs true/false)
- Added template system with pre-built suggestions
- Added API facade support with documentation ingestion
- Improved user flow with better prompts and exit logic
- Location: `/tools/mcp_server_factory.py`

### 2. Service Layer Updates
- Updated `/packages/templates/elf-control-center/src/services/mcp-factory.ts`
- Added new interfaces: Resource, Prompt, PromptArgument, ApiConfig
- Updated MCPFactoryConfig to match new factory
- Updated getTemplates() with new template definitions
- Updated validation and complexity estimation

### 3. UI Page Updates (COMPLETED)
- Updated `/packages/templates/elf-control-center/src/app/mcps/create/page.tsx`
- Redesigned flow to match new factory:
  - Step 1: Template selection with visual cards
  - Step 2: Basic information with API config for api-facade
  - Step 3: Component configuration with template suggestions
  - Step 4: Review and create
- Added template suggestion system with accept/reject
- Added support for resources and prompts
- Added API configuration UI for api-facade template
- Proper TypeScript types imported from service

## Key Features Implemented

### Template Selection UI
- 6 visual template cards with icons
- Clear descriptions and examples
- Template selection drives the rest of the flow

### Template Suggestions
- Each template provides suggested tools/resources/prompts
- Users can accept/reject each suggestion
- Accepted suggestions are merged with custom additions

### API Facade Support
- Special configuration section for API facade template
- API documentation URL, base URL, authentication settings
- FamilySearch API shown as example

### Component Configuration
- Separate sections for tools, resources, and prompts
- Custom addition forms for each type
- Visual lists showing all configured components

### Review Page
- Complete summary of configuration
- Component counts displayed visually
- Clear list of what will be created

## Next Steps
The UI is now fully updated to match the new MCP Server Factory capabilities. Users can:
1. Select from 6 different templates
2. Configure server type (internal/external) and transport (http/stdio/sse)
3. Add API configuration for api-facade servers
4. Accept/reject template suggestions
5. Add custom tools, resources, and prompts
6. Review and create their MCP server

The UI properly generates the factory command that can be run manually if the backend integration is not available.
