# API Key Verification Report

## Summary of Issues Found

### 1. ❌ Supabase Service Role Key Issue
**Problem**: Your `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is actually an `anon` key, not a `service_role` key.
- Current role: `anon`
- Expected role: `service_role`

**Fix**: You need to get the correct service role key from your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lcyzpqydoqpcsdltsuyq/settings/api
2. Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the `anon` key)
3. Replace `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` in your .env file

### 2. ⚠️ OpenAI Quota Exceeded
**Problem**: Your OpenAI account has exceeded its quota.
- Error: `insufficient_quota`
- This is a billing issue, not a key issue

**Fix**:
1. Check your OpenAI billing at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method or upgrade your plan
3. The key itself appears to be valid

### 3. ✅ Working Correctly
- **Anthropic API**: Working perfectly
- **Supabase Anon Key**: Correct and working
- **Environment Variables**: All present and properly formatted

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Get the correct Supabase service role key**:
   ```bash
   # After getting the correct key, update it in .env:
   SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

2. **Check OpenAI billing**:
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
   - Add credits or payment method

3. **Re-run verification**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/testing/verify_api_keys.py
   ```

## Current Status
- ✅ Anthropic API: Ready to use
- ❌ OpenAI API: Quota exceeded (billing issue)
- ⚠️ Supabase: Anon key works, but service role key needs to be fixed
- ✅ Environment setup: Properly configured

The key rotation was mostly successful, but you need to:
1. Get the correct Supabase service role key
2. Address the OpenAI billing issue
