# Mac Mini Setup - Where We Are

## What We've Accomplished âœ…
1. Created team-based architecture (replacing 200+ individual agents)
2. Built Executive team Kubernetes manifests
3. Pushed k8s/teams to GitHub (ArgoCD can now see it)
4. Fixed .gitignore to exclude node_modules

## What's Left To Do ðŸš€

### Option 1: Simple Setup (Recommended)
On your Mac Mini, run:
```bash
cd /path/to/ELFAutomations
git pull
bash scripts/setup-mac-mini-simple.sh
```

This script will:
- Install OrbStack (if needed)
- Enable Kubernetes
- Install ArgoCD
- Configure it to watch your GitHub repo
- Deploy the Executive team

### Option 2: Check Current Status
If you're not sure where the setup got stuck:
```bash
cd /path/to/ELFAutomations
git pull
bash scripts/check-mac-mini-status.sh
```

This will show you:
- What's installed
- What's running
- What's missing

### Option 3: Manual Troubleshooting
See `docs/MAC_MINI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for:
- Common issues and fixes
- Step-by-step manual setup
- How to reset everything

## The End Goal
Once set up, you'll have:
- ArgoCD watching your GitHub repo
- Automatic deployment when you push changes
- Executive team running in Kubernetes
- UI at http://localhost:8080 (after port-forward)

## Important Notes
1. You'll need to add real API keys:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit secret llm-api-keys -n elf-teams
   ```

2. The Executive team won't actually run without valid OpenAI/Anthropic keys

3. ArgoCD syncs every 3 minutes, but you can force sync in the UI

## If You Get Stuck
The simplified approach means:
- Everything is in one script
- Clear error messages
- Troubleshooting guide available
- Can reset and start over easily
