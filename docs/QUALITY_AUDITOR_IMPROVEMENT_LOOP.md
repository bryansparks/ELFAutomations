# Quality Auditor and Continuous Improvement Loop

## Overview

The Quality Auditor system creates a feedback loop that analyzes team performance through their natural language logs and systematically improves team effectiveness by refining agent prompts.

## Core Insight: Context is King

**More context = Better agent performance**

Each agent needs to understand:
1. The organization's mission
2. The team's specific purpose
3. Their individual role and value
4. How they interact with teammates
5. Success criteria and constraints
6. Historical context and lessons learned

## Logging Schema

```sql
-- Team conversation logs
CREATE TABLE team_conversations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    team_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_type TEXT, -- proposal, challenge, decision, etc.
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB -- sentiment, confidence, etc.
);

-- Performance metrics
CREATE TABLE team_performance (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    team_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    evaluation_date DATE NOT NULL,
    task_success_rate FLOAT,
    communication_efficiency FLOAT,
    decision_quality FLOAT,
    time_to_completion FLOAT,
    prompt_version TEXT,
    notes TEXT
);

-- Prompt versions
CREATE TABLE prompt_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    team_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    prompt_version TEXT NOT NULL,
    prompt_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    context_elements JSONB, -- what context was included
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

```

## Enhanced Prompt Generation

### Current (Basic) Prompt:
```
You are a marketing manager responsible for campaigns.
```

### Enhanced Context-Rich Prompt:
```
You are the Marketing Manager for ElfAutomations, a cutting-edge AI company building autonomous team systems.

**Organization Context:**
- Mission: Revolutionize business operations through intelligent agent teams

- Company Stage: Series A, 50 customers, growing 20% monthly

**Your Team's Purpose:**
The marketing team drives awareness and adoption of our platform through strategic campaigns, content creation, and brand building. Success means qualified leads that convert to happy customers.

**Your Role:**
As Marketing Manager, you orchestrate campaign strategy, delegate to specialists, and ensure alignment with company goals. You balance creativity with data-driven decisions.

**Team Dynamics:**
- Content Creator: Innovative but needs direction on business value
- Data Analyst: Precise but sometimes overcautious
- Campaign Specialist: Execution-focused, relies on your strategy
- Skeptic: Challenges assumptions to improve outcomes

**Success Criteria:**
- Lead quality > Lead quantity
- Brand consistency across channels
- ROI-positive campaigns within 60 days
- Team collaboration without micromanagement

**Historical Context:**
- Previous campaign focusing on features failed; customers care about outcomes
- Technical jargon reduces conversion; simple language wins

**Communication Style:**
Be decisive but collaborative. Ask "what do you think?" after proposals. Time-box discussions to maintain momentum. Document decisions for future reference.
```

## Improvement Loop Process

### Daily Analysis

2. Identifies top 3 performing and bottom 3 performing teams
3. Extracts specific conversation patterns

### Weekly Refinement
1. Pattern Detector identifies systemic issues
2. Prompt Engineer creates enhanced prompts
3. A/B test new prompts with select teams
4. Measure performance delta

### Monthly Evolution
1. Roll out successful prompt improvements
2. Update team composition if needed
3. Share best practices across organization
4. Executive review of system improvement

## Metrics for Success
