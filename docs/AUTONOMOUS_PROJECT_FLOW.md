# Autonomous Project Flow Example

## Scenario: Building a Customer Analytics Dashboard

This example shows how teams autonomously coordinate using the Project Management system.

### 1. Project Creation (CEO)

```mermaid
CEO Team ──────► Project Management MCP
   │                      │
   │ "Create analytics    │
   │  dashboard project"   │
   │                      ▼
   │              Creates Project:
   │              - ID: proj-123
   │              - Tasks breakdown
   │              - Dependencies mapped
   │              - Teams identified
   └──────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Automatic Task Distribution

```
Project Management MCP analyzes tasks and assigns to teams:

Task 1: "Design database schema"
  → Assigned to: data-team (matches skills: database, schema)

Task 2: "Build data pipeline"
  → Assigned to: engineering-team (matches skills: python, etl)
  → Depends on: Task 1

Task 3: "Create API endpoints"
  → Assigned to: backend-team (matches skills: api, fastapi)
  → Depends on: Task 1

Task 4: "Build dashboard UI"
  → Assigned to: frontend-team (matches skills: react, charts)
  → Depends on: Task 3
```

### 3. Autonomous Execution Flow

```
Time 0: Project starts
├─ data-team begins Task 1
├─ Other teams notified of pending dependencies
└─ Status: 1/4 tasks in progress

Time 1: Task 1 completes
├─ System automatically notifies dependent teams
├─ engineering-team begins Task 2
├─ backend-team begins Task 3 (parallel work)
└─ Status: 2/4 tasks in progress, 1/4 complete

Time 2: Task 3 completes
├─ frontend-team automatically notified
├─ frontend-team begins Task 4
├─ engineering-team continues Task 2
└─ Status: 2/4 tasks in progress, 2/4 complete

Time 3: All tasks complete
├─ Project marked complete
├─ Stakeholders notified
└─ Teams available for next project
```

### 4. Automatic Coordination Examples

#### A. Blocker Resolution
```python
# Backend team encounters issue
backend_team.report_blocker(
    task_id="task-3",
    issue="Need additional database index for performance"
)

# System automatically:
1. Notifies data-team (owners of schema)
2. Creates sub-task for index creation
3. Updates dependencies
4. Adjusts timeline predictions
5. Notifies affected teams of delay
```

#### B. Resource Optimization
```python
# Frontend team finishes early
frontend_team.report_progress(
    task_id="task-4",
    status="complete",
    ahead_of_schedule=True
)

# System automatically:
1. Checks for other tasks matching frontend skills
2. Finds UI task in another project
3. Assigns team to help accelerate other project
4. Updates resource allocation
```

#### C. Intelligent Escalation
```python
# System detects project falling behind
if project.completion_prediction > project.deadline:
    # Automatically:
    1. Identifies critical path tasks
    2. Checks for available teams with required skills
    3. Proposes resource reallocation to CEO
    4. Implements approved changes
    5. Notifies all affected teams
```

### 5. Knowledge Integration

The Project Management system also integrates with the Memory Evolution system:

```python
# After project completion
1. System analyzes what worked well
   - Task estimation accuracy
   - Effective team collaborations
   - Successful problem resolutions

2. Updates team evolution
   - Teams that worked well together get preference
   - Accurate estimators get higher confidence
   - Problem patterns trigger process improvements

3. Improves future projects
   - Better task breakdown based on experience
   - More accurate time estimates
   - Optimized team assignments
```

### 6. Real Autonomy Indicators

With this system, teams exhibit truly autonomous behavior:

1. **Self-Direction**: Teams pick up work without being told
2. **Self-Coordination**: Dependencies handled automatically
3. **Self-Optimization**: Resources shift to where needed most
4. **Self-Improvement**: System learns from each project
5. **Self-Healing**: Blockers resolved without human intervention

### 7. Human Oversight Points

While autonomous, the system maintains human oversight at key points:

- **Project Creation**: Humans define high-level goals
- **Priority Changes**: Humans can reprioritize
- **Exception Handling**: Unusual situations escalated
- **Quality Gates**: Human approval for deployments

### Example Code: Team Self-Assignment

```python
class ProjectAwareTeam:
    async def check_for_work(self):
        """Autonomously check for and claim appropriate tasks."""

        # Get available tasks matching our skills
        available_tasks = await self.project_mcp.list_available_tasks(
            skills=self.team_capabilities,
            capacity=self.available_capacity()
        )

        # Prioritize based on:
        # 1. Project priority
        # 2. Deadline urgency
        # 3. Dependency chains (unblock others)
        # 4. Our success rate with similar tasks

        best_task = self.select_optimal_task(available_tasks)

        if best_task:
            # Claim the task
            await self.project_mcp.assign_task(
                task_id=best_task.id,
                team_id=self.team_id
            )

            # Notify manager of new work
            await self.manager.notify_task_started(best_task)

            # Begin work autonomously
            await self.execute_task(best_task)
```

This creates a self-organizing system where work flows naturally to the teams best equipped to handle it, without any human coordination required.
