### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Approval Mechanisms

**Priority**: High
**Target**: Next Sprint
**Status**: Planned

**Description**:
Implement human approval workflows for critical executive decisions made by the Chief AI Agent, ensuring human oversight for high-impact business decisions.

**Requirements**:
- **Approval Workflows**: Configurable approval chains for different task types
- **Notification System**: Real-time notifications for pending approvals
- **Decision Tracking**: Audit trail of all human approvals and rejections
- **Escalation**: Automatic escalation for time-sensitive decisions

**Implementation Components**:
1. **Approval Engine**:
   - Task classification system (auto-approve vs. requires approval)
   - Configurable approval rules based on task type, priority, and impact
   - Multi-level approval chains for complex decisions

2. **User Interface**:
   - Approval dashboard in web interface
   - Mobile-friendly approval interface
   - Detailed task context and AI reasoning display

3. **Notification System**:

**Approval Categories**:
- **Auto-Approve**: Analysis, reporting, low-impact recommendations
- **Manager Approval**: Resource allocation, process changes, medium-impact decisions
- **Executive Approval**: Strategic planning, major resource allocation, high-impact decisions
- **Board Approval**: Company-wide policy changes, major strategic shifts

**Technical Architecture**:
```
Task Submission ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Approval Classification ‚Üí
[Auto-Execute | Human Approval Required] ‚Üí
Notification ‚Üí Human Decision ‚Üí Task Execution/Rejection
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
