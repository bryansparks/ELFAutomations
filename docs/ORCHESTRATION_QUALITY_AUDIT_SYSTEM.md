## Quality Audit Patterns

### 2. Quality Metrics Dashboard

```yaml
# Orchestration Quality Metrics

Team Performance:
  marketing-team:
    missed_orchestration_opportunities: 3
    coordination_efficiency: 72%
    avg_task_completion_variance: +18%
    recommendations:
      - Use workflow engine for multi-team campaigns
      - Implement project tracking for content series

  engineering-team:
    missed_orchestration_opportunities: 7
    coordination_efficiency: 58%
    avg_task_completion_variance: +35%
    recommendations:
      - Workflow engine critical for feature development
      - Project management for bug fix sprints

System-wide Patterns:
  - 65% of delayed projects had coordination issues
  - Teams using workflow engine: 25% faster completion
  - Project management users: 40% fewer "status check" messages

Learning Insights:
  - Threshold identified: 3+ teams = use workflow engine
  - Pattern detected: Approval delays reduced 60% with workflow
  - Discovery: Parallel execution saves average 2.5 days
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Audit (Week 1)
- Deploy missed orchestration detector
- Analyze last 30 days of logs
- Generate initial report

### Phase 2: Pattern Learning (Week 2-3)
- Implement pattern analyzer
- Build pattern library
- Create recommendation engine

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Week 4+)
- Automate improvement suggestions
- Update manager prompts
- Track improvement metrics

## Benefits

1. **Continuous Learning**: System improves based on real usage
2. **Evidence-Based**: Recommendations backed by data
3. **Preventive**: Catches issues before they become systemic
4. **Targeted**: Improvements specific to each team's needs

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in missed orchestration opportunities: Target 50% in 3 months
- Improvement in coordination efficiency: Target 80% across all teams
- Decrease in project delays: Target 30% reduction
- Increase in orchestration tool usage: Target 3x in appropriate scenarios

This quality audit system ensures that the powerful orchestration capabilities we've built are not just available, but actively identified when needed and continuously improved based on real-world usage patterns.
