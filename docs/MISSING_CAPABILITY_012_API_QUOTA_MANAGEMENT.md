# Missing Capability #012: API Quota and Cost Management

## The Problem
Teams hit API quota limits without warning:
- OpenAI quota exceeded
- No fallback mechanisms
- No cost tracking
- No warning before hitting limits

## Current State
- Direct API calls without monitoring
- No quota awareness
- No cost budgets per team
- No graceful degradation

## Desired State
- API usage monitoring per team
- Cost tracking and budgets
- Automatic fallback to cheaper models
- Warning alerts before quota exhaustion
- Usage reports for CEO

## How It Should Work
1. Each team has API budget
2. Usage tracked in real-time
3. Warnings at 80% usage
4. Automatic model downgrade if needed
5. CEO gets cost reports

## Options
1. **Quota Management MCP**: Track usage across all teams
2. **Built-in to teams**: Each team monitors its own usage
3. **Finance team responsibility**: CFO's team monitors costs

## The Deeper Issue
Without cost management:
- Teams can't operate autonomously
- Unexpected failures
- No budget planning
- Can't scale operations

## Priority
CRITICAL - Teams literally can't function without API access
