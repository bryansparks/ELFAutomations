# Research Team: Traditional vs MCP-Optimized

## Traditional Approach (6 Agents)
```
Research Team
├── Research Team Lead
├── Web Research Specialist (coded agent)
├── Academic Research Specialist (coded agent)
├── Social Media Analyst (coded agent)
├── Technical Research Specialist (coded agent)
└── Research Quality Skeptic
```

**Problems:**
- Each specialist is mostly making API calls
- Coordination overhead between 6 agents
- Complex communication patterns
- Higher compute costs (6 LLM instances)

## MCP-Optimized Approach (3 Agents + 8 MCPs)
```
Research Team
├── Agents (Intelligence Layer)
│   ├── Research Strategist (reimagined Team Lead)
│   │   └── Decides WHAT to research and WHY
│   ├── Research Synthesizer (reimagined Technical Specialist)
│   │   └── Interprets findings and creates insights
│   └── Research Skeptic
│       └── Validates sources and challenges conclusions
│
└── MCPs (Capability Layer)
    ├── Web MCPs
    │   ├── web-scraper-mcp
    │   └── content-parser-mcp
    ├── Academic MCPs
    │   ├── arxiv-mcp
    │   ├── pubmed-mcp
    │   └── semantic-scholar-mcp
    ├── Social MCPs
    │   ├── twitter-mcp
    │   ├── linkedin-mcp
    │   └── reddit-mcp
    └── Analysis MCPs
        ├── sentiment-mcp
        └── data-analytics-mcp
```

## Workflow Example: "Research our competitor's AI strategy"

### Traditional Flow:
1. Team Lead assigns to specialists
2. Web Specialist searches websites (LLM call for each site)
3. Academic Specialist searches papers (LLM call for each search)
4. Social Analyst checks Twitter (LLM call for each query)
5. All report back to Team Lead (more LLM calls)
6. Technical Specialist synthesizes (LLM call)
7. Skeptic reviews everything (LLM call)

**Total: 15-20 LLM calls**

### MCP-Optimized Flow:
1. Research Strategist determines approach (1 LLM call)
   - Uses web-scraper-mcp for competitor sites (direct API)
   - Uses arxiv-mcp for papers (direct API)
   - Uses twitter-mcp for social sentiment (direct API)
2. Research Synthesizer interprets all findings (1 LLM call)
3. Research Skeptic validates key claims (1 LLM call)

**Total: 3 LLM calls + direct API calls**

## Benefits:

1. **80% reduction in LLM costs**
2. **Clearer separation of concerns**
3. **Easier to add new capabilities** (just add MCPs)
4. **Faster execution** (parallel MCP calls)
5. **Better maintainability** (MCPs are simpler than agents)
