# Missing Capability #009: Team Factory Robustness

## The Problem
Team factory has multiple bugs:
1. Uses full description as filename (too long)
2. Undefined variable `crew_class` in deployment script generation
3. Not production-ready for autonomous use

## Current State
- Team factory crashes on valid inputs
- Multiple code paths not tested
- Blocks team creation
- Can't be used autonomously

## Bugs Found
1. **Filename issue**: Line 1034 uses team description as filename
2. **Undefined variable**: Line 2048 references undefined `crew_class`
3. **No error handling**: Crashes instead of graceful degradation

## Desired State
- Team factory should be bulletproof
- Handle all edge cases
- Never crash on valid input
- Provide helpful error messages
- Work autonomously without human debugging

## Impact
Without reliable team factory:
- Can't create teams autonomously
- CEO can't delegate team creation
- Blocks entire product development
- Requires manual intervention

## The Deeper Issue
If the core tool for creating teams isn't robust, how can ElfAutomations build products autonomously? This is a critical foundation piece that needs to be solid.

## Priority
CRITICAL - This is THE tool for building the organization
