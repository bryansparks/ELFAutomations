### Key Architecture Changes to Implement
1. **Replace LangGraph** with CrewAI individual agents
2. **Implement A2A communication** for inter-agent coordination
3. **Deploy one kagent CRD per agent type** instead of one for entire system
4. **Enable independent scaling** and monitoring per agent
5. **Build cross-department workflows** using A2A messaging

### Critical Success Factors
- **A2A Communication Reliability**: Ensure robust message delivery and context preservation
- **Independent Agent Scaling**: Validate that individual agents scale based on their workload
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Leverage full Kubernetes benefits for microservice architecture
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement detailed per-agent monitoring and optimization
- **Workflow Coordination**: Maintain business workflow integrity across distributed agents

**Ready to begin distributed agent development! Start with TASK-004-REVISED and follow the revised sprint plan.** 🚀

The distributed architecture will provide true Kubernetes-native benefits while enabling sophisticated multi-agent coordination through A2A communication patterns.
