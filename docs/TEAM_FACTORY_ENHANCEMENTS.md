**Before**: Agents received minimal prompts like "You are the Marketing Manager responsible for campaigns."

**After**: Agents receive comprehensive context including organization mission, team dynamics, success criteria, and communication guidelines.

### Architecture

#### Components
- **Prompt Template System** (`tools/prompt_template_system.py`)
  - Template management for different role types
  - Company-wide context sharing
  - Interactive context gathering
  - The CONTEXT framework

- **Integration** (`tools/team_factory.py`)
  - `_generate_enhanced_prompt()` method
  - `modify_agent_prompt()` for post-generation updates

#### The CONTEXT Framework
```
C - Company: Mission, stage, priorities
O - Objectives: Team and individual goals
N - Nuances: Personality, communication style
T - Team: Dynamics, roles, interactions
E - Experience: Historical lessons, what works
X - Expectations: Success criteria, constraints

### Adding All Enhancements to Team Factory

#### Step 1: Add Imports
```python
from prompt_template_system import PromptTemplateSystem
from agent_code_enhancer import AgentCodeEnhancer
from intelligent_team_composer import IntelligentTeamComposer
```

#### Step 2: Initialize in `__init__`
```python
def __init__(self):
    # ... existing init code ...

    # Initialize enhancement systems
    if PROMPT_TEMPLATES_AVAILABLE:
        self.prompt_system = PromptTemplateSystem()

    self.code_enhancer = AgentCodeEnhancer()
    self.team_composer = IntelligentTeamComposer()
```

#### Step 3: Modify Team Creation Flow
```python
def create_team(self):
    # Get team request
    team_request = Prompt.ask("What kind of team do you need?")

    # AI composition
    if Confirm.ask("Would you like AI to propose the optimal team composition?"):
        proposal = self.team_composer.propose_team_composition(team_request)
        # ... display and refine ...
        team_spec = self._convert_proposal_to_spec(proposal)

    # Enhanced prompts
    if Confirm.ask("Generate enhanced contextual prompts?"):
        for member in team_spec.members:
            member.system_prompt = self._generate_enhanced_prompt(member, team_spec)

    # Enhanced code generation happens automatically in agent generation
```

#### Step 4: Enhance Agent Generation
In `_generate_crewai_agents` and `_generate_langgraph_agents`, add capability enhancements before writing files.

## Conclusion

These three enhancements transform the Team Factory from a simple generator into an intelligent system that creates sophisticated, self-improving teams. Each enhancement addresses a critical aspect of agent effectiveness:

- **Prompts** = Understanding (the "why")
- **Code** = Capability (the "how")
- **Composition** = Structure (the "who")

Together, they ensure every team created is optimized for success from its very first moment of existence.
