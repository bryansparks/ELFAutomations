### 7. Monitoring and Observability
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for analysis
- **Metrics Export**: Prometheus-compatible metrics
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time API usage and costs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response times, success rates
- **Health Dashboards**: Grafana integration

### 8. Registry Integration
- **Automatic Registration**: Teams self-register in Supabase
- **Relationship Tracking**: Parent-child team hierarchies
- **Capability Discovery**: Other teams can find and communicate
- **Audit Logging**: All changes tracked for compliance

### 9. Resilience and Reliability
- **Fallback Protocols**: Graceful degradation during failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Intelligent backoff strategies
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic healing from transient issues
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU optimization

### 10. Development Experience
- **One-Command Creation**: Simple natural language input
- **Auto-Generated Documentation**: Comprehensive README files
- **Sample Tasks**: Example code for common patterns
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose support
- **Debugging Tools**: Built-in troubleshooting helpers
