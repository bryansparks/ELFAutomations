## Usage Examples

### 1. Create AI Customer Support Workflow
```bash
cd tools
python n8n_workflow_factory_v3.py create-ai \
  "Create a multi-channel customer support system with AI that handles email and Slack" \
  --name "AI Support Agent" \
  --team "support-team"
```

### 2. Analyze Existing Workflow
```python
from elf_automations.shared.n8n.workflow_analyzer import WorkflowAnalyzer

analyzer = WorkflowAnalyzer()
issues, metrics = analyzer.analyze_workflow(workflow_json)
```

### 3. Use Template Gallery
Navigate to Control Center → Workflows → Templates Gallery to:
- Browse curated AI workflow templates
- Preview workflow structure
- Deploy with one click
- Customize before deployment
