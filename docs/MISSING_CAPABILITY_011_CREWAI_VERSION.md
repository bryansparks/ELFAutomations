# Missing Capability #011: CrewAI Version Compatibility

## The Problem
Different versions of CrewAI have different requirements:
- Some versions require manager not in agents list
- Some versions require different Process types
- API changes between versions

## Current State
- No version pinning
- No compatibility checks
- Teams may work with one version but not another
- Breaking changes not documented

## Desired State
- Pinned versions for all dependencies
- Version compatibility matrix
- Automated testing with supported versions
- Clear upgrade paths

## The Deeper Issue
Without version control:
- Teams break when dependencies update
- Can't ensure consistent behavior
- Hard to debug version-specific issues
- No reproducible environments

## Priority
HIGH - Blocks reliable team operation
