# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Virtual AI Company Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 2025
**Product Manager:** [Your Name]
**Engineering Lead:** Windsurf AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

We are building a **Virtual AI Company Platform** that creates a fully functional organizational structure using AI agents. This platform will simulate a real company with hierarchical management, department specialization, cross-functional workflows, and measurable business outcomes - all powered by autonomous AI agents.

## Problem Statement

Current AI agent frameworks lack the organizational structure and coordination capabilities needed to simulate complex business operations. Most multi-agent systems are either too simplistic (single-purpose bots) or too complex (requiring extensive custom infrastructure). There's no standardized way to create AI agent hierarchies that mirror real corporate structures with proper delegation, reporting, and cross-departmental collaboration.

## Vision & Goals

### Primary Vision
Create the world's first fully autonomous virtual company where AI agents operate in realistic business hierarchies, complete with executive oversight, departmental specialization, and measurable business outcomes.

### Success Metrics
- **Agent Productivity**: 95%+ task completion rate across all departments
- **Inter-Agent Collaboration**: <2 second average response time for cross-department requests
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for critical business workflows
- **Scalability**: Support for 100+ concurrent agents without performance degradation
- **Business Simulation Accuracy**: Realistic business KPIs and reporting comparable to human-run organizations
