# Session Context - January 6, 2025

## Current Work: GraphDB & Multi-Tenant RAG Implementation

### What We Accomplished Today

1. **OpenRouter.ai Integration** ✅
   - Created `ChatOpenRouter` and `ChatLocalModel` providers
   - Updated `LLMFactory` with OpenRouter in fallback chain
   - Created test scripts and usage documentation
   - Ready to use but NOT YET ACTIVE (opt-in only)

2. **GraphDB & RAG Planning** ✅
   - Designed hybrid storage architecture (VectorDB + GraphDB + SQL)
   - Created comprehensive plans for document type processing
   - Chose Neo4j as GraphDB (with ArangoDB as alternative)
   - Designed single RAG team with pluggable processors

3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** ✅
   - Designed tenant hierarchy: Organization → Workspace → Collection
   - Created isolation strategies for all storage systems
   - Pattern: `{tenant}_{workspace}_{type}_{context}`
   - Example: `acme_corp_finance_invoice_2024_q1`

4. **Neo4j K8s Infrastructure** ✅
   - Created complete K8s manifests in `/k8s/infrastructure/neo4j/`
   - Separated infrastructure from teams for clean GitOps
   - Created deployment and test scripts
   - Configured for multi-tenant with label-based isolation

### Current Status

**Git Status:**
- All changes committed with message: "feat: Add GraphDB infrastructure and multi-tenant RAG foundation"
- Pushed to GitHub

**ArgoCD Status:**
- Created `elf-infrastructure` ArgoCD app
- Status shows "Unknown" sync status (needs manual sync)
- Infrastructure namespace not yet created

### Next Steps (Where We Left Off)

1. **Immediate Action Needed:**
   ```bash
   # On ArgoCD machine (Mac Mini)
   # Force sync the infrastructure app
   kubectl patch app elf-infrastructure -n argocd --type merge -p '{"operation": {"initiatedBy": {"username": "admin"},"sync": {"revision": "HEAD"}}}'

   # Or use the script:
   ./scripts/sync-infrastructure-app.sh
   ```

2. **After Sync Completes:**
   - Verify Neo4j is running: `./scripts/check-infrastructure-status.sh`
   - Test connection: `python scripts/test_neo4j_connection.py`
   - Access Neo4j browser at: `http://<node-ip>:30474`

3. **Next Development Tasks:**
   - Create GraphDB MCP using `mcp_factory.py`
   - Create multi-tenant collection manager MCP
   - Update RAG team with multi-tenant support
   - Start implementing document processors

### Key Files Created This Session

**Infrastructure:**
- `/k8s/infrastructure/neo4j/` - Complete Neo4j deployment
- `/k8s/infrastructure/kustomization.yaml` - Parent manifest
- `/scripts/create-infrastructure-argocd-app.sh` - ArgoCD setup
- `/scripts/deploy_neo4j.sh` - Manual deployment option
- `/scripts/test_neo4j_connection.py` - Connectivity test

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/GRAPHDB_RAG_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Master plan
- `/docs/MULTI_TENANT_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Tenant isolation design
- `/docs/OPENROUTER_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - OpenRouter integration guide

**Code:**
- `/elf_automations/shared/utils/providers/openrouter.py` - OpenRouter provider
- Enhanced `/tools/mcp_factory.py` with complexity detection

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Storage Strategy:**
   - Invoices: Graph-first (vendor relationships)
   - Contracts: Graph + Vector (relationships + similarity)
   - Research: Vector-first (semantic search)
   - Emails: Graph-first (communication networks)

2. **GitOps Structure:**
   ```
   k8s/
   ├── teams/              # Application workloads
   └── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure components
       ├── neo4j/         # Graph database
       ├── qdrant/        # Future: Vector DB
       └── monitoring/    # Future: Metrics
   ```

3. **Multi-Tenancy:**
   - Qdrant: Native collections per tenant
   - Neo4j: Label-based isolation
   - Supabase: Row Level Security (RLS)

### Important Notes

- Neo4j default credentials: `neo4j / elfautomations2025`
- OpenRouter NOT ACTIVE until you set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- All infrastructure managed through GitOps
- Multi-tenant architecture ready but not yet implemented in teams

### Resume Point
Need to sync ArgoCD app to deploy Neo4j, then continue with GraphDB MCP creation.
