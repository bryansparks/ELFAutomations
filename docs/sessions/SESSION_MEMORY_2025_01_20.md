# Session Memory: Team Factory Enhancements
**Date**: January 20, 2025
**Focus**: Skeptic Pattern Implementation & MCP Optimization

## 1. Skeptic Pattern Implementation ✅

### What We Added:
- **Personality Traits System**: Added `personality_traits` field to TeamMember dataclass
- **7 Trait Types**: skeptic, optimist, detail-oriented, innovator, pragmatist, collaborator, analyzer
- **Automatic Skeptic Assignment**: Teams with 5+ members automatically get a Quality Assurance Skeptic
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Extracts traits from team descriptions (e.g., "skeptical analytics expert")
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Personality traits modify agent system prompts

### Key Files Modified:
- `tools/team_factory.py` - Main implementation
- `docs/SKEPTIC_AGENT_PATTERN.md` - Documentation
- `test_skeptic_pattern.py` - Test suite

### Important: No functionality was degraded - all enhancements were additive.

## 2. Free Agent Team Support ✅

### Research Team Implementation:
- **Department**: "free-agent" (not in org hierarchy)
- **A2A Capabilities**: 10 registered capabilities for discovery
- **Sub-team Recommendations**: 3 specialized sub-teams suggested
- **Key Feature**: Any team can discover Research team via capability-based A2A discovery

### New Fields in TeamSpecification:
```python
is_free_agent: bool = False
a2a_capabilities: List[str] = []
reports_to: Optional[str] = None
sub_team_recommendations: List[SubTeamRecommendation] = []
```

## 3. MCP vs Agent Guidelines ✅

### Core Principle:
**"Agents = Brains, MCPs = Hands"**

### Key Insight:
Many "specialist" roles are actually 80%+ tool operations and should be MCPs, not full agents.

### Created Tools:
1. **`analyze_mcp_optimization.py`** - Analyzes roles for MCP potential
2. **`mcp_wishlist_manager.py`** - Tracks needed but missing MCPs
3. **`check_mcp_wishlist.py`** - Monitor wish list status

### MCP Wish List System:
- File: `mcp-wish-list.yaml`
- Tracks: requested MCPs, capabilities needed, priority, use case
- Integrated with team factory for automatic wish list updates

## 4. Research Team Analysis Results:

**Original**: 6 agents (all coded)
**Optimized**: 3 agents + 8 MCPs
- Keep: Research Team Lead, Technical Research Specialist, Quality Skeptic
- Convert to MCPs: Web, Academic, and Social Media specialists

## 5. Next Steps for Continuation:

1. **Implement MCP-optimized team generation** in team factory
2. **Create MCP factory integration** with wish list
3. **Add "hybrid mode"** where agents can use MCPs
4. **Build priority MCPs** from wish list (twitter-mcp, web-scraper-mcp)
5. **Test full workflow**: Team creation → MCP analysis → Wish list → MCP development

## 6. Key Commands:

```bash
# Test skeptic pattern
python test_skeptic_pattern.py

# Test research team creation
python test_research_team.py

# Check MCP wish list
python tools/check_mcp_wishlist.py

# Analyze team for MCP optimization
python tools/analyze_mcp_optimization.py
```

## 7. Architectural Decisions Made:

1. **Skeptic is automatic** for teams ≥ 5 members
2. **Free agent teams** use A2A discovery, not org hierarchy
3. **MCPs handle tool operations**, agents handle intelligence
4. **Wish list drives MCP development** based on actual needs

## Ready to Continue With:
- MCP-optimized team generation
- Hybrid agent/MCP architectures
- Building high-priority MCPs from wish list
