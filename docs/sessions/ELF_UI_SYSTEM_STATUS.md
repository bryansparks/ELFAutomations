cat docs/ELF_UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Definitions**: The UI package builds without `.d.ts` files due to type conflicts with Framer Motion and Radix UI
2. **Full CLI Features**: The complete CLI with all features (generate, connect) has syntax errors that need fixing
3. **Global CLI Link**: May require sudo to create global `elf-ui` command

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript Issues**: Update component types to properly extend motion components
2. **Complete CLI Features**: Fix the syntax errors in the full CLI commands
3. **Add More Components**: Timeline, KanbanBoard, DataTable, etc.
4. **Create Storybook**: Set up component documentation
5. **Add Tests**: Unit tests for components and CLI

## 🎨 What You Can Do Now

1. **Explore the Control Center**: Visit http://localhost:3002 to see the full dashboard
2. **Customize Themes**: Modify the theme in `packages/ui/src/themes/index.css`
3. **Create New Components**: Add to `packages/ui/src/components/`
4. **Build Your App**: Use the Control Center as a template for your own dashboards

The core system is functional and ready for use. The remaining issues are minor and can be addressed as needed.
