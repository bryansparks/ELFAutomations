# RAG Processor Team - Implementation Complete

## Summary
We've successfully created a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) processor team that handles document processing through a sophisticated pipeline with extraction, chunking, embedding, and graph storage capabilities.

## What Was Built

### 1. **LangGraph-Based Document Processing Team**
- Location: `/teams/rag-processor-team/`
- Framework: LangGraph state machine
- 7 specialized agents working in concert

### 2. **Agents Created**
1. **Queue Monitor** - Watches for new documents in processing queue
2. **Document Classifier** - Identifies document types (contracts, invoices, technical docs)
3. **Entity Extractor** - Extracts document-specific entities with normalization
4. **Smart Chunker** - Multiple chunking strategies (semantic, structural, entity-aware)
5. **Embedding Generator** - Creates embeddings with different models based on content
6. **Graph Builder** - Constructs Neo4j knowledge graphs from entities/relationships
7. **Storage Coordinator** - Manages multi-store persistence (Qdrant, Neo4j, Supabase)

### 3. **Key Features**
- **Flexible Schema System**: Dynamic extraction schemas per document type
- **Multi-Strategy Chunking**: Preserves document structure and entity boundaries
- **Graph-Enhanced RAG**: Combines vector search with graph traversal
- **Multi-Store Architecture**:
  - Qdrant for vector embeddings
  - Neo4j for relationship graphs
  - Supabase for metadata and queue management
- **Entity Normalization**: Standardizes dates, amounts, organization names
- **Fault Tolerance**: Retry logic, rollback capabilities, integrity checks

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- `POST /process` - Queue document for processing
- `GET /status/{document_id}` - Check processing status
- `POST /search` - Semantic search with entity enrichment
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /ready` - Readiness probe
- `GET /capabilities` - Team capabilities

### 5. **Deployment Readiness**
- Dockerfile with all dependencies
- Kubernetes manifests with proper resource limits
- Health checks and readiness probes
- ConfigMaps for team and A2A configuration
- Build script for proper image creation
- Added to Docker transfer script

```

### Database Schema
```
/sql/create_rag_extraction_tables.sql
```
Contains tables for:
- Flexible extraction schemas
- Extracted entities and relationships
- Document classifications
- Chunk relationships
- Processing history

### Supporting Scripts
```
/scripts/verify_rag_schema_simple.py  # Schema verification
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **Apply Database Schema**
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Create new query
3. Copy contents from: sql/create_rag_extraction_tables.sql
4. Run the query
```

### 2. **Build and Deploy**
```bash
# Build Docker image
cd teams/rag-processor-team
./build.sh

# Transfer to ArgoCD machine
cd ../..
./scripts/transfer-docker-images-ssh.sh

# Deploy via GitOps
git add -A
git commit -m "Add RAG processor team"
git push
```

### 3. **Configure Connections**
Create Kubernetes secrets for:
- Neo4j credentials
- Qdrant connection
- Supabase credentials (if not already present)

### 4. **Test Deployment**
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n elf-teams -l app=rag-processor-team

# Test document processing
curl -X POST http://rag-processor-team:8000/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_id": "test-doc-1",
    "tenant_id": "tenant-1",
    "source_path": "/path/to/document.pdf"
  }'
```

## Integration Points

### With Google Drive MCP
The Google Drive watcher can queue documents for processing by calling the RAG processor's `/process` endpoint.

### With Executive Team
Executive team can query processed documents through the `/search` endpoint for decision-making.

### With N8N Workflows
N8N can trigger document processing and monitor status through the API endpoints.

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Can process multiple documents in parallel
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new document types and extraction schemas
3. **Intelligence**: LLM-based classification and extraction
4. **Searchability**: Combined vector + graph search for better results
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with specialized agents

## Technical Decisions

1. **LangGraph over CrewAI**: Better for structured workflows with defined states
2. **Multi-Store Approach**: Leverages strengths of each storage system
3. **Entity Normalization**: Ensures consistent data across documents
4. **Flexible Schemas**: Allows handling unknown document types
5. **A2A Protocol**: Enables integration with other teams

The RAG processor team is now ready for deployment and integration with the rest of the ELF Automations ecosystem!
