# AgentGateway Upgrade Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the AgentGateway configuration upgrade and MCP deployment preparation for your GitOps environment with ArgoCD.

## Changes Made

### 1. AgentGateway Configuration Enhancement
- **Updated**: `/k8s/base/agentgateway/kustomization.yaml`
  - Changed from `config.json` to `mcp-config.json`
  - Enables advanced features: health checks, observability, RBAC, rate limiting

- **Fixed**: `/config/agentgateway/mcp-config.json`
  - Corrected team-registry path from `/mcp-servers-ts` to `/mcp/typescript/servers/team-registry/server.js`
  - Added google-drive-watcher MCP configuration

### 2. MCP Deployment Infrastructure
- **Created**: `/k8s/argocd-apps/elf-mcps.yaml`
  - ArgoCD Application definition for MCPs
  - Watches `k8s/mcps/` directory
  - Deploys to `elf-mcps` namespace

- **Prepared**: MCP deployment structure
  - Use `/scripts/prepare_mcp_deployment.sh` to set up `k8s/mcps/` directory
  - Copies google-drive-watcher manifests to GitOps location

### 3. Documentation
- **Created**: `/docs/AGENTGATEWAY_CONFIGURATION_PLAN.md`
  - Comprehensive plan for MCP and A2A integration
  - Phased implementation approach

- **Created**: `/docs/AGENTGATEWAY_UPGRADE_STATUS.md`
  - Current status of MCP readiness
  - Deployment instructions

## MCP Server Status

| MCP | Configured | Deployable | Notes |
|-----|------------|------------|-------|
| supabase | ✅ | ✅ | External npm package |
| team-registry | ✅ | ⚠️ | Path fixed, needs testing |
| business-tools | ✅ | ❌ | No deployment infrastructure |
| google-drive-watcher | ✅ | ✅ | Ready to deploy |

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare MCP Deployment
```bash
# Run the preparation script
./scripts/prepare_mcp_deployment.sh

# This will:
# - Create k8s/mcps/google-drive-watcher/ directory
# - Copy Kubernetes manifests
# - Create README documentation
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image (if needed)
```bash
# Build google-drive-watcher image
./scripts/build_google_drive_watcher.sh

# Transfer to ArgoCD machine
./scripts/transfer-docker-images-ssh.sh
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes to Git
```bash
# Add all changes
git add k8s/base/agentgateway/kustomization.yaml
git add config/agentgateway/mcp-config.json
git add k8s/argocd-apps/elf-mcps.yaml
git add k8s/mcps/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Upgrade AgentGateway and add MCP GitOps infrastructure

- Switch AgentGateway to enhanced mcp-config.json
- Add google-drive-watcher MCP with correct path
- Create ArgoCD application for MCP deployments
- Fix team-registry path issue
- Enable health checks, metrics, and RBAC"

# Push to trigger ArgoCD
git push
```

### Step 4: Apply ArgoCD Application
Since you don't have kubectl access, the ArgoCD application for MCPs needs to be created. Options:
1. Add to your ArgoCD setup scripts
2. Have someone with access run: `kubectl apply -f k8s/argocd-apps/elf-mcps.yaml`
3. Use ArgoCD UI to create the application

## What ArgoCD Will Do

1. **Update AgentGateway**:
   - Reload configuration with new MCP servers
   - Enable health monitoring and metrics
   - Start RBAC and rate limiting

2. **Deploy MCPs** (after ArgoCD app is created):
   - Create `elf-mcps` namespace if needed
   - Deploy google-drive-watcher
   - Monitor k8s/mcps/ for future MCP additions

## Configuration Features Now Enabled

- **Health Checks**: 30-second intervals for all MCPs
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, JSON logging, Jaeger tracing
- **Security**: Bearer token auth, RBAC policies
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute default
- **MCP Discovery**: Static configuration with future dynamic support

## Next Phase: A2A Integration

After confirming MCP deployment works:
1. Review A2A integration benefits in the configuration plan
2. Consider implementing AgentGateway as A2A router
3. Add team communication policies and monitoring

## Scripts Created

1. **`/scripts/explore_a2a_agentgateway_integration.py`**
   - Demonstrates A2A routing concepts
   - Shows benefits of centralized communication management

2. **`/scripts/build_google_drive_watcher.sh`**
   - Builds the google-drive-watcher Docker image

3. **`/scripts/prepare_mcp_deployment.sh`**
   - Sets up k8s/mcps/ directory for GitOps

## Troubleshooting

If AgentGateway fails to start after update:
1. Check if environment variables are set (SUPABASE_URL, etc.)
2. Verify MCP paths are correct in the container
3. Review AgentGateway logs for specific errors

## Success Metrics

You'll know the upgrade is successful when:
1. ✅ AgentGateway pods restart and become ready
2. ✅ Logs show MCPs being loaded
3. ✅ google-drive-watcher pod starts in elf-mcps namespace
4. ✅ Metrics endpoint shows MCP statistics
